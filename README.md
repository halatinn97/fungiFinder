### Description: 

This app will allow the user to search any Fungus and find the respective information about it. It accesses the https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/ REST API, which has millions of records on different Fungi species and their worldwide observations. 

### Purpose & Challenges:

This project will start out using Vanilla JavaScript, which acts mainly as a learning exerience as I have previously used React for routing. Since this project will entail dynamic, as well as static routing, without the use of any frameworks, it will serve additional challenge and allow me to explore the differences in the implementation thoroughly.

### User stories:

- As a user, I want to search Fungi visually, without knowing the correct name
- As a user, I want to search Fungi through a searchbar
- As a user, I want to find details about a specific Fungus 
- As a user, I want to know where I can find out more information about each Fungus (external research)
